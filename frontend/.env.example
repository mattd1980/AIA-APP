# Dev: backend URL (Vite uses this when running npm run dev)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Production when frontend and backend are separate (e.g. two Railway services):
# Set to your backend root URL so API calls and Google OAuth use the same origin as the session cookie.
# Example: https://aia-app-backend.up.railway.app (no trailing slash)
# If unset, the app assumes same-origin (single deployment).
# BACKEND_URL below is for the frontend server proxy only, if used.
